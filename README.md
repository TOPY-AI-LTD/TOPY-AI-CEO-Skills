[TOPY.AI](https://topy.ai) writes and maintains founders' business plans and keeps their CEO records:
decisions, risks, growth experiments, investors, GTM plans, research and the founder journal. These
skills teach Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Pi and other agents to run that work the way a
good CEO would.

- **Core** (23, `topy-ai` plugin): connect, the goal tree and operating board, the daily brief and weekly review, milestones, KPIs and alerts, business plans,
  revisions and templates, investor-ready checks, SEIS Advance Assurance, and every CEO record. They
  use the TOPY.AI MCP server.
- **Strategy, fundraising, finance, operations, leadership** (28): decision memos, OKRs, user journeys, monthly close, plan vs actual, business
  models, pitch decks, term sheets, cap tables, financial models, unit economics, runway, hiring,
  board meetings, crisis response, debiasing and more. Most work without a TOPY account and offer to
  save the outcome to TOPY when it is connected.

Every change in TOPY takes two calls: a preview the agent shows you, then a confirmed call after you
say yes. Skills never confirm for you.

## Install

```sh
npx @topy-ai/ceo-skills install                  # this project, for the agents set up here
npx @topy-ai/ceo-skills install -g               # your user: every project
npx @topy-ai/ceo-skills install -g -a codex,pi   # pick the agents
npx @topy-ai/ceo-skills install --category fundraising,finance
npx @topy-ai/ceo-skills list                     # the catalogue
```

The core skills always come along. Supported agents: Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Cursor, Gemini CLI,
OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Amp, Cline, Goose, Kiro, Qwen Code, Trae, Roo Code, Kilo Code,
Augment, Factory Droid, OpenHands and Antigravity. See the
[installer README](packages/skills/README.md) for folders, updates and removal.

Other ways:

- **Claude Code plugins**: `/plugin marketplace add TOPY-AI-LTD/TOPY-AI-CEO-Skills`, then
  `/plugin install topy-ai-all@topy-ai` (or one plugin, such as `topy-ai@topy-ai` with the MCP server).
- **Codex plugins**: `codex plugin marketplace add TOPY-AI-LTD/TOPY-AI-CEO-Skills`, then
  `codex plugin add topy-ai@topy-ai`.
- **Pi**: `pi install npm:@topy-ai/ceo-skills`.
- **By hand**: each skill is a self-contained folder with a `SKILL.md`; copy
  `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<id>/` into the folder your agent reads, or zip one and upload it in
  Claude.ai → Settings → Capabilities → Skills.

## Connect TOPY.AI

The core skills run on `https://topy.ai/mcp` (OAuth 2.1: sign in to TOPY.AI, no keys to paste).

| Client | How |
|---|---|
| Claude, ChatGPT (web, desktop) | add a custom connector with the URL `https://topy.ai/mcp` |
| Claude Code | `claude mcp add --transport http topy https://topy.ai/mcp`, or `npx @topy-ai/ceo-skills install --mcp` |
| Codex | `codex mcp add topy --url https://topy.ai/mcp` |
| Gemini CLI, Cursor, others with remote MCP | server URL `https://topy.ai/mcp` |
| Clients that only start a command | `npx -y @topy-ai/ceo-mcp` after `npx @topy-ai/ceo-mcp login`, or with `TOPY_API_KEY` |
| Terminal and scripts | `npm i -g @topy-ai/ceo-cli && ceo-cli login` |

Scheduled agents use their own API key with a **standing permission** granted in the dashboard:
see the `topy-scheduled-agent` skill.

## How the skills fit together

```

                     topy-daily  ·  topy-weekly-review  ·  topy-scheduled-agent
```

A typical week: `topy-daily` each morning for the three things that matter; strategy and finance
skills when a decision comes up, with the outcome saved by `topy-decision-log`; `topy-weekly-review`
on Friday; `topy-plan-revision` when a figure, milestone or hire changes, so the whole plan stays
consistent; `topy-investor-ready` and the fundraising skills before a raise.

Try: *"Connect to TOPY.AI"*, *"What needs my attention as CEO today?"*, *"Is my plan investor-ready?"*,
*"Raise £250k instead of £200k across the whole plan"*, *"How much runway do we have?"*

## Packages

| Package | What it is |

The skills are generated from a source catalogue kept next to TOPY.AI's MCP server; the build checks
every tool a skill names against the server's tool list. Please open an issue rather than editing a
`SKILL.md`.

## Releases

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). `v0.7.0` reorganised the catalogue into 42 skills in six plugins; `v0.8.0` added the operating records (51 skills);
`v0.7.1` named the packages `@topy-ai/ceo-cli`, `@topy-ai/ceo-mcp` and `@topy-ai/ceo-skills`.

| [`topy-runway`](plugins/topy-ai-finance/skills/topy-runway/SKILL.md) | connected | Measure burn and runway properly, check whether the company is default alive, and build a tiered cut plan with triggers so the founder decides early instead of in a panic. |
